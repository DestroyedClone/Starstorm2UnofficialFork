# Starstorm 2 Unofficial

Unofficial update to the Pre-SotV version of Starstorm 2. **[Get the official version here!](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/)**

Executioner and Nemesis Commando are based on the version from the pre-SotV build with some tweaks, while Cyborg/Chirr/Pyro have been re-coded from the ground up due to the old code being unworkable.

This mod can be used alongside the official version of Starstorm 2. Be sure to go through your configs to disable duplicated features.

I've gotten permission to work on this project and host it here, and permission to upload it to Thunderstore as a hidden mod.

The SS2 team is free to use any of the new code from this mod as long as this repo is allowed to stay up and credit is given.

## Features

- New Survivors:
  - Executioner
