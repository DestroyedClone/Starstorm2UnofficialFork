# Starstorm 2 Unofficial

Unofficial update to the Pre-SotV version of Starstorm 2. **[Get the official version here!](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/)**

This mod can be used alongside the official version of Starstorm 2. Be sure to go through your configs to disable duplicated features.

I've gotten permission to work on this project and host it here, but do not have permission to upload this to Thunderstore.

The SS2 team is free to use any of the new code from this mod as long as this repo is allowed to stay up and credit is given.

## Features

- New Survivors:
  - Executioner
  - Cyborg
  - Chirr
  - Pyro
