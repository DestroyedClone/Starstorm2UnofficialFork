# Starstorm 2 Unofficial

Unofficial update to the Pre-SotV version of Starstorm 2. **[Get the official version here!](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/)**

This mod is incompatible with the official version of SS2, so make sure you're not running both at the same time.

I've gotten permission to work on this project and host it here, but do not have permission to upload this to Thunderstore.

The SS2 team is free to use any of the new code from this mod as long as this repo is allowed to stay up.

## Features

- New Survivors:
  - Executioner
  - Cyborg
  - Chirr
  - Nemesis Commando
  
 - Storms
 
 *Items/Equipments are currently disabled.*

## Installation

1. Download the latest zip from [Releases](https://github.com/Moffein/Starstorm2Unofficial/releases).
2. In r2modman, go to Settings -> Import Local Mod
3. Select Starstorm2.dll, and import it. If it asks for Author/Version number, just leave them as the default.
