# Starstorm 2 Unofficial

Unofficial update to the Pre-SotV version of Starstorm 2. **[Get the official version here!](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/)**

I've gotten permission to work on this project and host it here, but do not have permission to upload this to Thunderstore.

The SS2 team is free to use any code from this mod.

## Installation

1. Download the latest zip from [Releases](https://github.com/Moffein/Starstorm2Unofficial/releases).
2. In r2modman, go to Settings -> Import Local Mod
3. Select Starstorm2.dll, and import it. If it asks for Author/Version number, just leave them as the default.
